# NetZeroX – AI + IoT Powered Carbon Footprint Tracker

NetZeroX is an end-to-end platform that integrates IoT sensors, a Python + Flask backend, Firebase database, and an AI model to monitor and predict carbon emissions in real time.
This project showcases strong integration skills by connecting hardware, cloud, APIs, and machine learning into a single working system.

# Features

IoT Integration: ESP8266/ESP-01 sends live sensor data (temp, humidity, IR)<br>
REST API Backend: Flask-based API for receiving and processing data<br>
Cloud Storage: Firebase used to store real-time sensor values<br>
AI Model: CO₂ emission prediction using pre-trained ML model<br>
Dashboard Ready: Data prepared for visualization on a frontend dashboard<br>
User Auth (Planned): Username/password login system<br>
3D Animated Earth Intro (Planned): For UI enhancement<br>
